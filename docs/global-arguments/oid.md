(argument_oid)=

# {argument}`oid` / {argument}`oids`

## Description

The {argument}`oid` argument (and its alias {argument}`oids`) is used to
specify one or more object IDs to the command being used. The exact manner in
which the object IDs are used depends on the command, so refer to each
command's documentation for more detail.

Multiple object IDs are specified as a comma-delimited list,
e.g. `--oid 0x1234,0x5678,0x9abc`.
